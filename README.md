# ETH-ASSESSMENT

This is an assessment for Metacrafters regarding Ethereum tokens using Solidity.

## Assessment Description

The assessment requires to use Solidity on gas/fuel. Functions were used in this program such as the mint function (to create tokens) and the burn function (to destroy tokens).

## Getting Started

### Installing and Running
* Open [Remix IDE] (https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your local web browser.
* Locate the folder where contracts are located. You can create a new contract by clicking the "+" icon.
* Save the file as a .sol file

* For running the file, you must first compile the solidity program file.
* After compiling, a small but brief interface will be provided for the user to play around with.
* The interface will display with the corresponding functions mint and burn.
* Input any integer in the mint function then click the button. To verify this, click the transact button. This will add tokens in the account.
* Similarly for the burn function, add an integer value for the amount of token to be removed from the account. Click burn and then click transact to verify.

* The balances function will display the current balance of the account.
